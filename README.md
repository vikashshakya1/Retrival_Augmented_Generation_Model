# README: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Model

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is designed to answer user queries by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base and generating context-aware responses. It is particularly suited for question-answering tasks where the context is essential for accurate results.

---

## Features
- **Question Answering**: Uses the `question-answering` pipeline to provide detailed answers based on retrieved context.
- **Customizable Models**: Allows you to specify any compatible pretrained model, such as `Intel/dynamic_tinybert`.
- **Flexible Context Input**: Processes dynamic context provided at runtime for real-time query resolution.

---

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or above.
2. Required libraries:
   - `transformers`
   - `torch`
   - `datasets`
   - `huggingface-hub`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets huggingface-hub
```

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and set up the model and tokenizer:
   Modify the `model_name` variable in the script to specify the desired pretrained model:
   ```python
   model_name = "Intel/dynamic_tinybert"
   ```

4. Run the RAG pipeline.

---

## Usage
### Example: Answering Questions
```python
from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer

# Specify the model
model_name = "Intel/dynamic_tinybert"

# Load the tokenizer and define the pipeline
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model=model_name, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Provide context and a question
context = (
    "Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 â€“ July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, "
    "philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809."
)
question = "Who is Thomas Jefferson?"

# Get the answer
result = qa_pipeline({"context": context, "question": question})
print(result["answer"])
```

---

## Inputs and Outputs
### Input
- **Context**: A block of text containing relevant information.
- **Question**: A query related to the provided context.

### Output
- **Answer**: A concise response based on the context.

---

## Customization
1. **Change the Model**: Replace `Intel/dynamic_tinybert` with any compatible Hugging Face model:
   ```python
   model_name = "bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad"
   ```

2. **Adjust Tokenizer Settings**: Modify parameters like `max_length` or `padding` in the tokenizer setup:
   ```python
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, max_length=512, padding=True)
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting
1. **ValueError: Input Format**: Ensure the input to the pipeline is a dictionary with `context` and `question` keys.
   Example:
   ```python
   {"context": "Your context here", "question": "Your question here"}
   ```

2. **Model Compatibility**: Verify that the specified model supports the `question-answering` pipeline.

3. **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all libraries are installed and updated:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade transformers torch
   ```
